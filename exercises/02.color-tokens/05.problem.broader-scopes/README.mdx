# Broader Scopes

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tutorials/tailwind-color-tokens/color-design-tokens/broader-scopes" />

You know how we accidentally broke background transparency in a previous exercise?

Well, we've broken things again, without meaning to.

Here's an example: try make the `highlight` box have a gradient background fading from `highlight` to white (`bg-neutral`):

```html
<div className="... from-highlight to-neutral bg-gradient-to-r">...</div>
```

Uuuuh â€” `from-` and `to-` classes only suggest `inherit`, `current`, and `transparent` as possible values.

Yup. The colors we added to the `backgroundColor` core plugin are only available for... background colors.

## Broaden the scope of where colors are allowed

Background gradient options are controlled by the `gradientColorStops` corePlugin. The background colors should probably be added there too.

What about `outline` or `ring` utilities? Sounds like they should share the `borderColor` options, right?

There is a decent amount of `color`-related [corePlugins in Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#configuration-reference). You don't need to add **all** of them in this exercise, but add a few.

And remember this moment â€” because you'll almost inevitably reach a point where some color somewhere doesn't work, because you've accidentally scoped it too narrowly.

ðŸ’° Tip: since you're going to want to share the same color customisations for multiple core plugins, you can create a JS object with the colors to add, and re-use that object multiple times for various corePlugins ðŸ¤™
