# Cutoff Default Colors

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tutorials/tailwind-color-tokens/color-design-tokens/cutoff-default-colors" />
By extending the theme, we still hace access to all the default colors.

While that's very useful for prototyping, in this case we don't want devlopers to start using `zinc` instead our custom `grey`, or `indigo` instead of our `accent`.

Make sure the only colors available in the theme are the custom ones you've added.
