# Dark Mode

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tutorials/tailwind-color-tokens/color-design-tokens/dark-mode" />

You've seen that you can change the color values "on the fly" like so:

```tsx
<Demo style={{ '--color-bg-subtle': '0 0% 19%' }} />
```

But you don't want to be passing style attributes everytime you want to do that.

Instead, you're going to leverage the "theme scopes" concept you have learned about in previous exercises.

## Dark Mode Support

In this exercise, you're actually going to add support for a fully functional **dark mode** implementation.

And, thanks to the hard work from the previous exercises, this is going to be incredibly easy.

### 1. Enable the `darkMode` "class" strategy in the Tailwind config

In the <InlineFile file="tailwind.config.ts" /> file, add a `darkMode: 'class'` option to the Tailwind config.

```diff
export default {
	content: [...],
+	darkMode: 'class',
	theme: {...}
```

### 2. Add the `dark` class to the second `<Demo />` component instance

Replace the inline style attribute with a `className` attribute that includes the `dark` class.

```diff
<>
 <Demo />
- <Demo style={{ '--color-bg-subtle': '0 0% 19%' }} />
+ <Demo className="dark" />
</>
```

### 3. Redefine the semantic color token CSS variables

In the CSS file's `base` layer block, below the `:root` selector scope, add a new `.dark` selector.

In there, redefine the semantic color tokens by pointing them to different raw color variables.

Here's an example:

```css
@layer base {
	:root {
		/* "base" raw color and semantic color tokens */
	}

	.dark {
		--color-bg-subtle: var(--color-grey-80);
		/* ... */
	}
}
```

The Figma file does not show the dark mode values, but here's a suggestion of how you could map the colors:

| Semantic Token                | Dark Mode Mapping |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `--color-bg-highlight`        | `173 100% 30%;`   |
| `--color-bg-accent`           | `263 100% 70%;`   |
| `--color-bg-neutral`          | `grey-100`        |
| `--color-bg-neutral-inverted` | `grey-0`          |
| `--color-bg-subtle`           | `grey-80`         |
| `--color-bg-bold`             | `grey-5`          |
| `--color-border-bold`         | `grey-40`         |
| `--color-border-subtle`       | `grey-60`         |
| `--color-border-muted`        | `grey-80`         |
| `--color-text-copy`           | `grey-0`          |
| `--color-text-subtle`         | `grey-40`         |
| `--color-text-muted`          | `grey-60`         |
| `--color-text-inverted`       | `grey-90`         |

<callout-info>
	Notice that the `highlight` and `accent` colors are not mapped to an existing
	color token. None of the existing raw color values really work in dark mode,
	so we've defined new `H` `S` `L` channels. Those are the same colors with a
	modified `Lightness` for better contrast in dark mode.
</callout-info>

## Watch it come together

As you redefine the semantic color tokens for `dark` mode, you should see the UI of the second `<Demo />` component come together progressively!

This should be pretty satisfying.
