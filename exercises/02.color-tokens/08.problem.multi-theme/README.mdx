# Multi-Theme Support

Let's use the exact same approach to add support for multiple color themes â€” independent of dark mode.

## Add a new theme scope

You're going to add a `citrus` theme to the project.

This theme needs a scope selector, just like you did for `dark` mode.

You could use a `.citrus` class â€” but there's something nice about using something other than a class selector for a theme toggle.

How about a `data-theme` attribute? That's pretty explicit, right?

### 1. Create a new theme scope selector in CSS

In the <InlineFile file="src/index.css" /> file, add a `[data-theme="citrus"]` selector.

### 2. Redefine semantic color tokens within that scope

You could go crazy and redefine all the color tokens within the `data-theme="citrus"` scope â€”Â but for the sake of this exercise, only redefine the `hightlight` and `accent` colors.

Use what you want â€”Â but here are two yellow and orange `HSL` color suggestions that feel pretty "citrus-ey":

| Color       | HSL value          |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| `highlight` | `hsl(60 100% 50%)` |
| `accent`    | `hsl(30 100% 50%)` |

### 3. Add `dark` support for your "citrus" theme

Make sure you also redefine `highlight` and `accent` colors for the scenario where both the `dark` mode and `citrus` theme are active:

```css
[data-theme='citrus'].dark {
	/* Dark citrus colors */
}
```

<callout-info>
	**Tip**: Keeping the same color hue (`H`) but changing the lightness (`L`)
	works pretty well to adjust vibrant colors for dark mode.
</callout-info>

<callout-warning>
	**Warning**: Note that this selector above will only work if the `dark` class
	and the `data-theme="citrus"` attribute are applied to the **same HTML
	element**.
</callout-warning>

## Nesting themes and dark mode toggles

If you want to be able to nest and compose combinations of themes and dark mode, consider adding a few parent/child selector combinations:

```css
/* same element */
[data-theme='citrus'].dark,
/* parent <--> child */
[data-theme='citrus'] .dark,
/* reverse relationship */
.dark [data-theme='citrus'] {
	/* Dark citrus colors */
}
```

This will allow you to make any part of your HTML tree dark or light, citrus-themed or not, **independently of anything else** that has been set on parent elements.

And that's the superpower and flexibility of CSS variable scopes ðŸ”¥
