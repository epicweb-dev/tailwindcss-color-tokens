# Semantic Design Tokens

We've got our colors under control.

Well — actually we still have a problem with the current setup. Nothing is stopping anyone to use the `highlight` (`teal`) color (meant for background surfaces) on a text element, for example.

```html
<p className="text-teal ...">Special Deal</p>
```

<img src="/images/highlight-text-eww.png" />

Ewwww...

What's thaaaat?

😅

I don't think the designers wanted the `highlight` color to be used like that.

## Scope colors to specific use cases

We can lock down the usage of colors to specific scenarios by leveraging Tailwind's `corePlugins`.

The `colors` object makes a color available **everywhere**.

But you can target core plugins like `backgroundColor` to only allow colors to be used for _backgrounds_.

Or `borderColor` for borders, etc.

## Translate the Figma file's Semantic Color Tokens

Recreate the semantic tokens you can find in Figma in your Tailwind theme.

If you can't access the variables panel in Figma, here's a screenshot of the relevant color _mapping_.

## Update the UI to use the new, semantic tokens

Make sure the UI is using the new semantic tokens and still works properly!

You've got this — good luck!
