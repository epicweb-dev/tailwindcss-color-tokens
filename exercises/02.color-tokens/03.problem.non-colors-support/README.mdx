# "Non colors" support

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tutorials/tailwind-color-tokens/color-design-tokens/non-colors-support" />

It might look like everything is working properly â€” but with our `colors` override, we have accidentally removed some functionality.

For example, try to make the button's background transparent on hover:

```html
<a href="#" className="... hover:bg-transparent">Learn more</a>
```

If you hover this button, you'd expect the background to become... transparent, right?

Womp Womp. It doesn't work.

### The default colors are more than just _colors_.

The `colors` object in the Tailwind theme contains a few things beside "true" colors.

Go ahead, have a look at the [Tailwind docs (text-color, for example)](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color) to see what's in there.

Yup. `inherit`, `current`, `transparent`.

Well, we've removed all three by overriding the `colors` object.

And that's why our `bg-transparent` class has no effect.

## Bring these back

Make sure these three key-value pairs are also added to the colors object:

```ts
{
  inherit: 'inherit',
  transparent: 'transparent',
  current: 'currentColor',
}
```
