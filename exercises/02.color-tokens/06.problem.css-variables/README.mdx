# CSS Variables

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tutorials/tailwind-color-tokens/color-design-tokens/css-variables" />

## TL;DR

This is a big one. You're going to need to do the following:

1. Convert the `HEX` colors to `HSL` or any other color format that supports an _alpha channel_ opacity transparency
2. Move the colors from the JS file to the CSS file, defined as CSS variables
3. Recreate the semantic tokens abstraction as CSS variables
4. Update the Tailwind config file to consume those CSS variables

This piece of work requires a _certain_ understanding of CSS variables, so this page contains a _certain_ amount of theory.

## "Hardcoded" vs Swappable Color Classes

One of the key reasons we opted to use a semantic naming convention is to detach the color value from the use case.

And why did we do that? So that we can _change_ the color value, without departing from the semantic meaning applied to a specific element.

## CSS variables for the win!

CSS variables are defined with a two-dash prefix `--`, and consumed with the `var()` function.

Here’s an example:

```css
:root {
/* CSS var definition */
--highlight: #00FFE1;
}

.callout {
/* CSS var consumption */
background-color: var(--highlight);
...;
}
```

## Nested CSS variable scopes

A great feature of CSS variables is that they can be **redefined** within any CSS selector.

When doing so, the new value will only take effect within the _scope_ of that selector:

```css
:root {
--highlight: #00FFE1;
}

.callout {
background-color: var(--highlight);
...;
}

.callout--neon {
/* Redefine the value of an existing CSS variable */
--highlight: #52FF00;
}
```

With that in place, take the following markup:

```html
<div class="callout">Callout</div>
<div class="callout callout--neon">Neon callout</div>
```

Here’s how these two callouts would look like:

<div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr', gap: '1rem' }}>
	<div
		style={{
			background: '#00FFE1',
			padding: '1.5rem',
			fontSize: '1.3rem',
			fontWeight: 600,
		}}
	>
		Callout
	</div>
	<div
		style={{
			background: '#52FF00',
			padding: '1.5rem',
			fontSize: '1.3rem',
			fontWeight: 600,
		}}
	>
		Neon Callout
	</div>
</div>

The default callout is using the color value defined at the `:root` scope, while the The Neon callout uses the valued _scoped_ to the `.callout--neon` class.

## That's your theming recipe!

This CSS variable scoping is all you need to understand to know how to setup multiple color themes for a project.

You can create “theme scope” selectors, where you redefine these same CSS variables with new values.
Any HTML element within a given theme scope will get those updated values when reading on of the CSS variables!

These scopes can be anything: `data-theme="citrus"` for a citrus theme, `.dark` or `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` for dark-mode...

You get the idea — you can get creative with it!

## Tailwind (v3) Opacity Management

Let’s take a look at a `background-color` class for a default Tailwind CSS v3 color, like `bg-indigo-600` for example:

```html
<p class="bg-indigo-600">I love this color</p>
```

Here’s the CSS generated for this utility class:

```css
.bg-indigo-600 {
	--tw-bg-opacity: 1;
	background-color: rgb(79 70 229 / var(--tw-bg-opacity));
}
```

See that `--tw-bg-opacity` CSS variable? It’s being used to compose the opacity into the background color, which is defined as an `rgb()` color.

### CSS variable composition

By default, this opacity variable is set to `1`, or **full opacity**.

Let’s add a background opacity utilty to our paragraph tag:

```html
<p class="bg-indigo-600 bg-opacity-50">I love this color</p>
```

Can you guess what that `bg-opacity-50` class is doing?

Here's the answer:

```css
.bg-opacity-50 {
	--tw-bg-opacity: 0.5;
}
```

That’s right. It just redefines the value of the `--tw-bg-opacity` variable. It doesn’t apply any CSS property or anything!

Since the opacity utilities are generated _after_ the color utilities in the CSS file, the value of the `--tw-bg-opacity` CSS variable is updated to `0.5`.

As a result, the background color is now a `rgb()` color with a `0.5` **alpha channel**, or 50% opacity!

```diff
.bg-indigo-600 {
-  --tw-bg-opacity: 1;
+  --tw-bg-opacity: 0.5;
  background-color: rgb(79 70 229 / var(--tw-bg-opacity));
}
```

This is some pretty clever stuff, hopefully opening your eyes to what you can do with CSS variable composition.

Tailwind CSS is full of mind bending CSS variable composition tricks.

## Let's Get To Work!

Feewww — that was a lot of theory! Let's get our hands dirty now.

You'll notice that the main UI has been moved to a <InlineFile file="src/components/demo.tsx">`<Demo />`</InlineFile> component.

It's literally the exact same markup than at the end of the last exercise, with an extra wrapper that spreads props.

That allows us to pass attributes — like `className` or `data-*` attributes — to the component.

Here's what you need to do:

### 1. Convert the `HEX` colors to `HSL` (or other opacity-aware color format)

We need any other color format that supports an _alpha channel_ opacity transparency. You can use a vscode extension or ask AI to help you with that :)

<callout-warning class="important">
	To make this more complicated, you only need to define the separate channels
	for the color — not the color itself. Tailwind will [handle the alpha
	channel](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#using-css-variables)
	manually.
</callout-warning>

If you're using `HSL`, you literally want to store an `${H} ${S} ${L}` string, not the `HSL` color.

Something like `30 100% 50%`.

### 2. Move the colors from the JS file to the CSS file, defined as CSS variables.

Do this at the `:root` scope, in an `@layer base {}` block.

You can name the variables anything you like — but if you need a suggestion, go with this:

```css
@layer base {
	:root {
		--color-teal: YOUR_COLOR_HERE;
		--color-grey-0: YOUR_COLOR_HERE;
		/* ... */
	}
}
```

### 3. Recreate the semantic tokens abstraction as CSS variables

You need to port over the intentional "mapping" of the color tokens to semantic tokens to the CSS file, using CSS variables.

Here's an example that maps the `neutral` semantic color for the `backgroundColor` core plugin to the actual `grey-0` color:

```css
@layer base {
	:root {
		--color-bg-neutral: var(--color-grey-0);
	}
}
```

### 4. Update the Tailwind config file to consume those CSS variables

Finally, you need to update the `backroundColors`, `borderColors` and `textColors` objects used in the `tailwind.config.ts` file to consume the CSS variables you've defined.

### 5. Test the "swappability" of the new color tokens!

Whoaaa — this was a lot. We just want to verify that this was actually useful.

In <InlineFile file="src/App.tsx" />, add a second `<Demo />` component, and try to change the value of a CSS variable with an inline `style` attribute:

```diff
<>
  <Demo />
+ <Demo style={{ '--color-bg-subtle': '0 0% 19%' }} />
</>
```

This should set the value odf the `--color-bg-subtle` CSS variable to a the `hsl(0 0% 19%)` color — which is technically the `grey-[80]` color.

As a Result, you should see the second `<Demo />` component render with a dark grey background color!
