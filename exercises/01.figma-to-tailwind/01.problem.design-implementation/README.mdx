# Design Implementation

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tutorials/tailwind-color-tokens/figma-to-tailwind-css/design-implementation" />

This first exercise is about converting the Figma design to a Tailwind CSS project.

## High Fidelity Implementations

Delivering a high-quality design-to-code conversion is all about attention to details.

### Your challenge

Inspect the Figma file as closely as possible. Make sure you notice the differences between the mobile and desktop versions of the design.

Don't worry about using the right colors just yet — we'll implement those later. Use a grayscale color palette for now, using Tailwind's default colors. Have a look in the `Solution` tab for inspiration ✨

Ready? Go ahead and build the UI in the <InlineFile file="src/App.tsx" /> file.

Below are a couple of screenshots from inspecting the Figma design with [DevMode](https://www.figma.com/dev-mode/).

### Accessing Figma's DevMode

<callout-info>
	The Figma support team has generously allowed us to make the [Epic Web Figma
	Team](https://www.figma.com/@epicweb) an [education
	account](https://www.figma.com/education/) — which enables access to pro tools
	like DevMode!
</callout-info>

<callout-info>
	Education access requires enrolling with an email address + Figma account, and
	is typically reserved for folks who purchased a Pro workshop such as [Pixel
	Perfect Tailwind](https://pixel-perfect-tailwind.epicweb.dev).
</callout-info>

Don't worry — you can still inspect the design without DevMode — the file is publicly available to everyone!
