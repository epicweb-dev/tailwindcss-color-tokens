# Theme Configuration in CSS

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tutorials/tailwind-color-tokens/conversion-to-tailwind-v4/theme-configuration-in-css" />

Our project is already setup with Tailwind CSS v4.

<callout-warning>
	If you're using vscode, you might want to upgrade the Tailwind CSS
	Intellisense extension to the "pre-release" version to work with Tailwind v4.
</callout-warning>

## Tailwind CSS v4 upgrade

1. We've upgraded our Tailwind version and installed the new Tailwind CSS Vite plugin:

<CodeFile file="./package.json" range="17,31" />

2. We've registered the Vite plugin in <InlineFile file="vite.config.ts" />:

<CodeFile file="./vite.config.ts" highlight="1,7" />

3. We've replaced the three `@tailwind` directives in <InlineFile file="src/index.css" /> with a single `@import` statement:

```diff filename=src/index.css
- @tailwind base;
- @tailwind components;
- @tailwind utilities;
+ @import 'tailwindcss';
```

4. We've deleted the `postcss.config.js` file, which is no longer needed.

<callout-info>
	We _could_ also delete the`tailwind.config.ts` file, but we're keeping it
	around for reference of the work we've done.
</callout-info>

## Porting the theme configuration to CSS

Instead of defining the `backgroundColor`, `borderColor`, and `textColor` objects in the `tailwind.config.ts` file, you're going to register those in CSS directly.

The **GREAT** news is that Tailwind CSS v4 uses CSS Variables as the **primary theme configuration mechanism** — so a lot of our gymnastics between CSS and JS configuration is going to be greatly simplified.

The equivalent of Tailwind config's `theme.extend` in v4 is an `@theme` block in CSS.

The various theme core plugins can be extended (or overriden) by defining CSS variables with a specific naming convention.

<callout-info>
	Here is a [complete list of the CSS variable
	names](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/next/packages/tailwindcss/theme.css)
	for the `@theme` definition.
</callout-info>
<callout-info>
	The Tailwind Intellisense extension should give you autocomplete suggestions
	as you start typing `--` inside the `@theme` block.
</callout-info>

## 1. Move semantic token definition to the `@theme` block

Keep the raw color tokens in the `@layer base` for now (we'll address this later).

Take the semantic tokens CSS variables in your CSS file, and move theme outside of the `@layer base`, and into a new `@theme` block:

```css filename=src/index.css
@layer base {
	:root {
		/* raw color tokens (`--color-grey-0`, etc ) */
	}
}

@theme {
	--background-color-neutral: var(--color-grey-0);
	/* ... */
}
```

<callout-warning>Note that the CSS variable name hase changed from `--color-bg-neutral` to `--background-color-neutral`! This is to accomodate for the `@theme` naming convention.</callout-warning>

Here's a list of the tokens you need to move:

```css
/* Semantic tokens */
--color-bg-highlight: var(--color-teal);
--color-bg-accent: var(--color-purple);

--color-bg-neutral: var(--color-grey-0);
--color-bg-neutral-inverted: var(--color-grey-100);
--color-bg-subtle: var(--color-grey-5);
--color-bg-bold: var(--color-grey-80);

--color-border-bold: var(--color-grey-60);
--color-border-subtle: var(--color-grey-40);
--color-border-muted: var(--color-grey-20);

--color-text-copy: var(--color-grey-100);
--color-text-subtle: var(--color-grey-60);
--color-text-muted: var(--color-grey-40);
--color-text-inverted: var(--color-grey-5);
```

Make sure all the semantic color tokens are moved to the `@theme` and re-named accordingly.

<callout-warning>
	**Warning**: Doing this will not _replace the default Tailwind colors, but
	rather extend them.
</callout-warning>

Remember: we want to _override_ the default theme `colors`. Here's the way to do this in the `@theme`:

```css filename=src/index.css
@theme {
	--color-*: initial;
}
```

- `color-*` targets **all** `color` variables in the theme.
- `initial` clears those variables.

Effectively the equivalent of doing `theme.colors = {}` in the Tailiwnd config.

## 2. Rename `dark` and `theme` CSS variables to mirror the `@theme` CSS variables

The `@theme` variables become the new `:root` scope CSS variables for our project. Anywhere you redefine those variables (`dark`, `data-theme-"citrus"`) needs to be updated to reflect the new naming convention.

## 3. Use the full color syntax, not `H` `S` `L` channels

All the complexity of composing a color with Tailwind's internal `<alpha-value>` goes away`. You can just pass the full color (`HSL` in our case) to the CSS variable.

Update all CSS variables that use `H` `S` `L` channels to use the full `HSL` color syntax:

```diff filename=src/index.css
@layer base {
	:root {
-		--color-teal: 173 100% 50%;
+		--color-teal: hsl(173 100% 50%);
	}
}
```

If you've done everything right — the UI should once again have the correct colors for both themes, in both light and dark modes.
