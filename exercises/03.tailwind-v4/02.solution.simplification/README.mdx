# Simplification

## Ummm, that was annoying to do

Yep — I don't disagree. But here's something to lift up your mood again:

### We has color swatches again!

Because we're using color values directly and not referencing another CSS variable now, the Tailwind Intellisense is able to work out what actual color is being held in utility classes.

And we get our nice little color swatches back in the editor!

### Swatches are not theme-aware

Technically, it will always display the color defined in the `:root` scope (`@theme`).

But still — this is pretty neat and way better than nothing!
