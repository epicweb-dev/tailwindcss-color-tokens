# Tailwind CSS Color Tokens 🎨

In this workshop, we're going to define **semantic color tokens** in Tailwind CSS, to adhere to a convention set in a Figma design File.

We'll cover both Tailwind CSS v3 and v4 approaches 🔥

## What this workshop covers

In this workshop, you will...

- Convert a Figma design to a Tailwind CSS project
- Define custom colors in the Tailwind theme
- Create a semantic color token layer in the Tailwind theme
- Replace "hardcoded" colors with semantic color tokens in the UI
- Leverage CSS variables to make the color tokens themable
- Support dark mode 🌑 and multiple color themes 🎨
- Port a JS Tailwind theme configuration (v3) to a CSS-only configuration (v4)

## Semantic Design Tokens

As you can see, colors are first defined as "raw" color palette values — but there is an extra layer of abstraction that defines **semantic color tokens**.

Those design tokens are scoped to **background**, **text** and **border** colors.

## Color Variables in Figma

The design leverages Figma's variables to power the UI.

### Raw color tokens

First, "raw" color accessors are mapped to the color values directly:

	alt="screenshot of Figma's variables panel, showing the raw color tokens"
/>

### Semantic color tokens

Then, those raw color values are aliased to semantic color tokens:

<img
	src="/images/semantic-color-tokens.png"
	alt="screenshot of Figma's variables panel, showing the semantic color tokens"
/>

### Usage in the design

The design is consuming these semantic tokens to compose the UI:

	src="/images/color-tokens-usage.png"
	alt="screenshot of Figma's side panel, showing the use of semantic color tokens"
/>

### Multi-Theme Support

The idea behind this layer of design token abstraction: UI elements should not be directly connected to a specific color value — but instead us an aliased reference token.

This unlocks the ability to change an entire design system by changing the color tokens, opening doors to advanced theming strategies.

### Unified Design Language

The semantic naming convention of these tokens also allows teams to better communicate about the design system, and to create a shared design language.

Here's a visual representation of this design token layer, as presented on the [Atlassian Design System](https://atlassian.design/tokens/design-tokens)'s Design Tokens documentation page:
